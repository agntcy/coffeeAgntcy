## About the Project

**CoffeeAgntcy** is a reference implementation based on a fictitious coffee company to help developers understand how components in the **AGNTCY Internet of Agents** ecosystem can work together. It gives examples of the components of AGNTCY working together as a **Multi-agent System (MAS)**. 

This reference agentic application demonstrates how to:

- How **SLIM** enables **request-reply** , **unicast (fire & forget)** and **group communication** patterns.
- How tools and transports can be reused across agent implementations (e.g., **SLIM**, **NATS**, **MCP**)
- How protocol-agnostic bridges and clients interconnect modular agents
- How to orchestrate agents using **LangGraph** for structured and stateful workflows
- How to write **A2A** client and server agents
- How to integrate data sources (e.g., weather services via **MCP**)
- How to extend or swap agents modularly using AGNTCY tooling
- How to enable observability using **AGNTCY Observe SDK**
- How to enable identity using **AGNTCY Identity SDK**

### Setups Included

We currently provide two setups you can run to see how components from AGNTCY work together â€” one simple two-agent use case and the other a more complex MAS:

- **Corto**:  
  A two-agent, ready-to-run setup that highlights core agent interactions using agent-to-agent (A2A) messaging via configurable transports(default: AGNTCY's SLIM). Agents are orchestrated within a LangGraph. It also shows how to enable observability using Observe SDK.

  ðŸ‘‰ [View the Corto README](coffeeAGNTCY/coffee_agents/corto)

- **Lungo**:  
  A more advanced setup that will evolve over time as we mature components. The first release shows agents that use A2A communication via configurable transports (default: SLIM), are structured as directed LangGraphs, and include an MCP weather-aware farm that fetches live data. It also shows how to enable observability using Observe SDK. It also shows group communication patterns with sub agents like farms, shipper, accountant fulfilling coffee order.
