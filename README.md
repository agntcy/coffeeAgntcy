## About the Project

**Coffee Agntcy** is a real-world demo designed to help developers understand how components from Cisco’s **AGNTCY Internet of Agents** ecosystem fit together. It showcases modular, interoperable agent architectures that use flexible transport protocols and stateful LangGraph workflows to coordinate multi-agent behavior.

This project is ideal for developers building modern agent-based systems and looking to explore:

- How **SLIM** enables **broadcast** and **unicast** messaging
- How tools and transport can be reused across agent implementations (e.g., **SLIM**, **NATS**, **MCP**)
- How protocol-agnostic bridges and clients interconnect modular agents
- How to orchestrate agents using **LangGraph** for structured and stateful workflows
- How to integrate real-world data sources (e.g., weather services via **MCP**)
- How to extend or swap agents modularly using AGNTCY tooling

### Demos Included

We currently provide two demos, each targeting a different level of complexity and modularity:

- **Corto**:  
  A lightweight, ready-to-run demo that highlights core agent interactions using agent-to-agent (A2A) messaging over AGNTCY’s SLIM transport. Agents are orchestrated within a LangGraph, enabling simple but structured workflows.  
  👉 [View the Corto README](coffeeAGNTCY/coffee_agents/corto)

- **Lungo**:  
  A more advanced demo showcasing modular, extensible agentic components. Agents leveraging the A2A protocol communicate via configurable transports (default: SLIM), are structured as directed LangGraphs, and include real-world extensions—like a weather-aware farm that uses MCP to fetch live data.  
  👉 [View the Lungo README](coffeeAGNTCY/coffee_agents/lungo)
