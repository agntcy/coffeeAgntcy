## About The Project
Welcome to Coffee Agntcy ...

Coffee Agntcy showcases how Cisco AGNTCY components interoperate with a variety of agentic frameworks and transport mechanisms. It’s designed to demonstrate modular integration and real-world interoperability in agent-based systems.

We currently provide two demos:

- **Corto**: A lightweight, ready-to-run demo that highlights core agent interactions using agent-to-agent (A2A) messaging over AGNTCY’s own SLIM transport. The agents are orchestrated within a LangGraph, enabling structured, stateful workflows. Setup and usage instructions are available in the [corto README](coffeeAGNTCY/coffee_agents/corto).
- **Longo**: A more comprehensive demo that will explore advanced scenarios and integrations — *coming soon*.
