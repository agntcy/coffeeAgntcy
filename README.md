## About the Project

**Coffee Agntcy** is a reference implmentation based of fictious coffee company to help developers understand how components in the **AGNTCY Internet of Agents** ecosystem can work together. It give examples of the components of AGNTCY working togehter as a **Multi-agent System (MAS)**. The first setup of coffeeAgentcy shows how transport protocols and stateful LangGraph workflow are used to coordinate multi-agent behavior.

This project is ideal for developers building agent-based systems and looking to explore:

- How **SLIM** enables **broadcast** and **unicast** messaging
- How tools and transport can be reused across agent implementations (e.g., **SLIM**, **NATS**, **MCP**)
- How protocol-agnostic bridges and clients interconnect modular agents
- How to orchestrate agents using **LangGraph** for structured and stateful workflows
- How to integrate data sources (e.g., weather services via **MCP**)
- How to extend or swap agents modularly using AGNTCY tooling

### Setups Included

We currently provide two setups you can run to see how components from AGNTCY work together - one simple two agent used case and the other more as a complex MAS:

- **Corto**:  
  A two agent ready-to-run setup that highlights core agent interactions using agent-to-agent (A2A) messaging over AGNTCYâ€™s SLIM transport. Agents are orchestrated within a LangGraph.
  ðŸ‘‰ [View the Corto README](coffeeAGNTCY/coffee_agents/corto)

- **Lungo**:  
  A more advanced setup that will evaolve over time as we mature components.  The first release shows agents using A2A communicating via configurable transports (default: SLIM), are structured as directed LangGraphs, and include an MCP weather-aware farm that to fetch live data.  
  ðŸ‘‰ [View the Lungo README](coffeeAGNTCY/coffee_agents/lungo)
