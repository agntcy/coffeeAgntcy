# Agent Directory Integration Guide

This guide demonstrates how to integrate **coffeeAgntcy lungo** with **[agntcy dir](https://github.com/agntcy/dir)** for automated agent discovery and management.

## Overview

The integration enables automatic translation and publication of all lungo agent A2A cards to a local agntcy directory service. 

## Quick Start

### 1. Start the Directory Service

First, launch the agntcy directory API server, directory MCP server and registry:

```bash
docker-compose up -d dir-api-server dir-mcp-server zot
```

This starts:
- `dir-api-server`: The directory API service for agent record management
- `dir-mcp-server`: The MCP server in front of the API service
- `zot`: OCI-compliant registry for storing agent artifacts

### 2. Install Development Dependencies

Install the required development dependencies for the integration scripts:

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
```

### 3. Publish Agent Records

Run the automated agent record publication script:

```bash
./scripts/publish_agent_records.sh
```

This script scans the `agents/` directory and publishes agent records. The corresponding JSON files for each agent will be stored in the appropriate `supervisors` subfolder (e.g., `agents/supervisors/auction/oasf/agents/`). **Do not modify these JSON files directly**—they are served as static files via APIs, and are intentionally kept static because publishing and processing records can be time-consuming at startup or runtime. Our goal is to showcase the record publishing process; if you want to experiment, feel free to manually run the instructions above.

> **Note:** MCP server JSONs are not generated by this script—they are manually added by us. Automated support for MCP JSON generation is not available yet.

This script will:
- Scan the `agents/` directory for A2A card definitions
- Convert agent metadata to OASF format
- Upload records to the running directory service
- Generate content identifiers (CIDs) for published records

### 4. Verify and Interact with Records

After publishing, you can:

1. **View published records**: Check the generated `published_cids.json` file for CIDs of your published agents
2. **Interact with directory**: Use the `dirctl` CLI tool to query and manage directory records
