# Group Conversation

This document explains how to run the logistics multi\-agent conversation locally (via Docker Compose or individual `make` targets) and how an order progresses through the system.

## 1. Services / Agents

| Role                | Python entrypoint                              | Purpose                                                             |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Logistic Supervisor | `agents/supervisors/logistic/main.py`         | Starts the workflow, handles user input, emits `RECEIVED_ORDER`     |
| Shipper Agent       | `agents/logistics/shipper/server.py`          | Progresses shipping states (`CUSTOMS_CLEARANCE`, `DELIVERED`)        |
| Accountant Agent    | `agents/logistics/accountant/server.py`       | Confirms payment (`PAYMENT_COMPLETE`)                                |
| Tatooine Farm Agent | `agents/logistics/farm/server.py`             | Moves order to `HANDOVER_TO_SHIPPER` after `RECEIVED_ORDER`          |

## 2. Order Lifecycle

Sequence (agent → state produced):

1. Supervisor → `RECEIVED_ORDER`  
2. Farm Agent → `HANDOVER_TO_SHIPPER`  
3. Shipper Agent → `CUSTOMS_CLEARANCE`  
4. Accountant Agent → `PAYMENT_COMPLETE`  
5. Shipper Agent → `DELIVERED` (final)  

### Transition Table

| From State        | To State              | Responsible Agent |
|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| (User Prompt)     | `RECEIVED_ORDER`      | Supervisor        |
| `RECEIVED_ORDER`  | `HANDOVER_TO_SHIPPER` | Farm Agent        |
| `HANDOVER_TO_SHIPPER` | `CUSTOMS_CLEARANCE` | Shipper Agent     |
| `CUSTOMS_CLEARANCE` | `PAYMENT_COMPLETE`   | Accountant Agent  |
| `PAYMENT_COMPLETE` | `DELIVERED`          | Shipper Agent     |

### Flow (ASCII)

```
User Prompt
↓
[Supervisor] → RECEIVED_ORDER → [Farm]
[Farm] → HANDOVER_TO_SHIPPER → [Shipper]
[Shipper] → CUSTOMS_CLEARANCE → [Accountant]
[Accountant] → PAYMENT_COMPLETE → [Shipper]
[Shipper] → DELIVERED (final)
```

## Run With Docker Compose (includes SLIM transport)

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.logistic.yaml up
```

Starts: supervisor, shipper, accountant, farm, SLIM transport.

---

## Run Individually (one terminal per service)
Terminal 1:
```sh
# The LLM env vars (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`) are required the logistic-supervisor.
make logistic-supervisor
```
Terminal 2:
```sh
make shipper
```
Terminal 3:
```sh
make accountant
```
Terminal 4:
```sh
make logistic-farm
```
