# Group Conversation

This document explains how to run the logistics multi-agent conversation locally (via Docker Compose or individual `make` targets) and how an order progresses through the system.

## 1. Services / Agents

| Role                | Python entrypoint                       | Purpose                                                         |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Logistic Supervisor | `agents/supervisors/logistic/main.py`   | Starts the workflow, handles user input, emits `RECEIVED_ORDER` |
| Shipper Agent       | `agents/logistics/shipper/server.py`    | Progresses shipping states (`CUSTOMS_CLEARANCE`, `DELIVERED`)   |
| Accountant Agent    | `agents/logistics/accountant/server.py` | Confirms payment (`PAYMENT_COMPLETE`)                           |
| Tatooine Farm Agent | `agents/logistics/farm/server.py`       | Moves order to `HANDOVER_TO_SHIPPER` after `RECEIVED_ORDER`     |

---

## 2. Order Lifecycle

Sequence (agent → state produced):

1. Supervisor → `RECEIVED_ORDER`
2. Farm Agent → `HANDOVER_TO_SHIPPER`
3. Shipper Agent → `CUSTOMS_CLEARANCE`
4. Accountant Agent → `PAYMENT_COMPLETE`
5. Shipper Agent → `DELIVERED` (final)

### Transition Table

| From State            | To State              | Responsible Agent |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- |
| (User Prompt)         | `RECEIVED_ORDER`      | Supervisor        |
| `RECEIVED_ORDER`      | `HANDOVER_TO_SHIPPER` | Farm Agent        |
| `HANDOVER_TO_SHIPPER` | `CUSTOMS_CLEARANCE`   | Shipper Agent     |
| `CUSTOMS_CLEARANCE`   | `PAYMENT_COMPLETE`    | Accountant Agent  |
| `PAYMENT_COMPLETE`    | `DELIVERED`           | Shipper Agent     |

### Flow (ASCII)

```
User Prompt
↓
[Supervisor] → RECEIVED_ORDER → [Farm]
[Farm] → HANDOVER_TO_SHIPPER → [Shipper]
[Shipper] → CUSTOMS_CLEARANCE → [Accountant]
[Accountant] → PAYMENT_COMPLETE → [Shipper]
[Shipper] → DELIVERED (final)
```

## Run With Docker Compose (includes SLIM transport)

**Step 1: Run the SLIM Message Bus Gateway and Observability stack**

To enable A2A Group communication over SLIM, you need to run the SLIM message bus gateway.

Additionally, run the observability stack that includes OTEL Collector, Grafana, and ClickHouse DB. You can do this by executing the following command:

```sh
docker-compose up slim clickhouse-server otel-collector grafana
```

**Step 2: Run the Group Conversation Stack**

If you want to run the group conversation stack separately, you can do so by running the following command:

```sh
docker-compose up logistic-farm logistic-supervisor logistic-shipper logistic-accountant
```

This will start the supervisor, shipper, accountant, farm, and SLIM transport services.

---

## Run Individually (one terminal per service)

Terminal 1:

```sh
# The LLM env vars (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`) are required the logistic-supervisor.
make logistic-supervisor
```

Terminal 2:

```sh
make shipper
```

Terminal 3:

```sh
make accountant
```

Terminal 4:

```sh
make logistic-farm
```

## Testing the Group Conversation

To test the group conversation, you can execute the following command:

```sh
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:9090/agent/prompt \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "I want to order  5000 lbs of coffee for 3.52 $ from the Tatooine farm."
  }'
```

Expected output:

```json
{
  "response": "Order ORD-3A7F5B2C from Tatooine for 500 units at $3.50 has been successfully delivered."
}
```

## Group Communication UI

## Observability

Follow substeps 1-3 from **Step 6: Visualize OTEL Traces in Grafana** in the main [README](../README.md) to set up Grafana and import the **Group Conversation Dashboard** [`group_conversation_dashboard.json`](../group_conversation_dashboard.json) for monitoring the logistics multi-agent workflow traces.
